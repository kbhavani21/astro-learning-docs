## Content-driven Approach
<div id="content-driven">
<span class="font-bold">Astro excels at creating content-rich websites,</span> including marketing, publishing, documentation, blogs, portfolios, landing pages, community sites, and e-commerce platforms. Unlike many modern web frameworks, which are geared towards complex web applications, Astro is optimized for performance and simplicity in content delivery.

## Server-first Rendering
<div id="server-first">
Astro emphasizes <a class="underline" href="https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/rendering-modes/">server-side rendering,</a> a method that has been proven effective by traditional server-side frameworks like PHP, WordPress, and Ruby on Rails. Unlike other modern JavaScript frameworks that focus on client-side rendering and include server-side rendering mainly for performance, Astro's Multi-Page App (MPA) approach leverages server-rendering to enhance performance metrics like Time to Interactive (TTI).
</div>

## Performance by Default
<div id="fast-by-default">
Performance is crucial for websites that rely on content display. Poor performance can lead to reduced engagement, conversions, and revenue. Astro combines content focus with a server-first architecture to deliver features that improve web performance, ensuring it is nearly impossible to create a slow website.

For example, Astro websites can load 40% faster with 90% less JavaScript than similar sites built with popular React frameworks.

## Ease of Use
<div id="easy-to-use">
<span class="font-bold">Astro is designed to be approachable and familiar, even for developers.</span> The <span class="text-[13px] bg-[#EDEEF3] px-2 py-1">.astro</span> UI language extends HTML, making it easy to create Astro components with basic HTML knowledge. Additionally, it supports popular UI component languages like React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, and Lit, allowing you to reuse existing components.

Astro simplifies the development process by eliminating the need for complex concepts like hooks, refs, observables, and reactivity, making it less complex than other UI frameworks.
